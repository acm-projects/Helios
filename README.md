<h1 align="center"> Helios ☀️🛠️ </h1>

<div align="center">
An intelligent MCP server generator that transforms complex APIs into clean, agent-friendly tool interfaces.  
Helios uses **user intent**, not just documentation, to design optimized MCP servers that reduce tool overload and dramatically improve AI agent reliability.  
</div>

## Summary ✍️

As AI agents become more capable, they are increasingly expected to interact with real-world APIs.  
However, most APIs were designed for humans, not agents. When large APIs with dozens or hundreds of endpoints are naively converted into MCP tools, agents face *tool overload*, poor context management, and unreliable decision-making.

**Helios** solves this problem by treating MCP server generation as an *intelligent design task*, not a mechanical conversion.

Instead of exposing every endpoint, Helios asks users to describe **how they want the API to be used**. It then analyzes API documentation alongside user intent to generate **purpose-built MCP servers** where tools are grouped semantically, scoped appropriately, and optimized for agent comprehension.

The result is a clean, deployment-ready MCP server that exposes *only what matters*, organized in ways that align with real usage patterns—whether the server runs locally or is hosted remotely.

## MVP 🏆

### API & Documentation Ingestion
- Accept API specs in multiple formats:
  - OpenAPI / Swagger
  - Postman collections
  - Raw or prose documentation
- Support for:
  - Public APIs (REST, GraphQL)
  - Private/authenticated APIs
- Parse authentication schemes:
  - API keys
  - OAuth
  - Bearer tokens
- Extract:
  - Endpoints, methods, parameters
  - Request/response schemas
  - Descriptions and metadata

### Intent-Driven Tool Generation
- Users describe their intended usage in natural language
- Helios determines:
  - Which endpoints are relevant
  - Which should be excluded
- Groups endpoints into logical tool categories  
  (e.g., *Search Operations*, *Task Management*, *User Profiles*)
- Generates:
  - Minimal, focused tool sets
  - Tool descriptions optimized for agent understanding

### Intelligent Tool Grouping & Server Architecture
- Avoids one-tool-per-endpoint design
- Creates semantic groupings based on functionality and scope
- Designs modular server architectures
- Supports cascading server layouts:
  - Read-only vs write servers
  - Search vs mutation servers
- Generates metadata explaining server purpose and boundaries

### MCP Server Code Generation
- Produces complete, deployment-ready MCP servers
- Initial support:
  - TypeScript / Node.js
- Includes:
  - Authentication handling
  - Error management
  - Rate limiting
  - Inline documentation and comments
- Generates configuration templates:
  - `.env.example`
  - API credential placeholders

### Deployment Guidance
- Step-by-step local deployment instructions
- MCP client configuration (Claude Desktop, others)
- Environment variable setup
- Troubleshooting for common issues

### Basic Web Interface
- Upload API documentation or provide API URLs
- Text area for intent description
- Preview generated tool groupings before code generation
- Download generated server as a packaged project
- View autogenerated deployment instructions

Helios is built with an **agent-first philosophy**: fewer tools, better structure, smarter servers.  
Instead of overwhelming agents with APIs, Helios helps them *understand* and *use* them.
